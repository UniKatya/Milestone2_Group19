## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Project Objectives

The project's objectives are to develop a user-friendly data analysis and visualisation tool for a comprehensive nutritional food database. This will be achieved through a Graphical User Interface (GUI) and multiple features such as allowing the user to search for foods by their name, charts that show the breakdown of the selected food, two nutrition filtering systems with a range/content level that is selected by the user, and a customisable meal planner. 

### 1.2 Project Stakeholders

Stakeholders in this project:

**Internal:**
1.	Group members 

This is the team that develops the project. They are responsible for the initiation, planning, execution, controlling, and closing of the project. Each member is responsible for specific tasks assigned to them by the Project Manager. 

2.	University Professor

This is the professor that oversees the project, guiding the team and providing feedback during the development of the project. 

3.  Project Manager

This is one of the chosen team members that organizes the team and assigns tasks to each member of the group. They coordinate tasks and makes sure that the project progresses smoothly and complies with the due dates of the project.  


**Potential End-users:**
1.	Students

The students are the primary users of the system as they will use the provided tools to search for foods and develop a better understanding of the nutritional breakdown of the searched foods. They will also be able to use this system for their own projects that require such information provided by the system. 

2.	Researchers

The researchers are the advanced users of the system as they will use the provided tools to analyse and develop their own academic/scientific projects.

3.	Health Enthusiasts

The health enthusiasts are general users that are interested in having a healthy diet provided by the platform that helps in managing their diet effectively. 



### 1.3 Project Scope

**Included:**
- User-friendly GUI designed for desktop.
- Features that provide the required services of the program (Food Search, Nutrition Breakdown, Nutrition Range Filter, Nutrition Level Filter, and Meal Planner).
- Data integration with The Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database to ensure accurate retrieval of nutritional data.
- Thorough testing of the application to ensure all features work. 
- Deployment of application on a private GitHub with multiple regular commits.

**Excluded:**
- Advanced features, such as this system being able to support multiple languages or more in depth analytics/information.
- Integration with other databases that are not The Comprehensive Nutritional Food Database.
- Advanced training manuals or support services on how to use the system.


## 2. Work Breakdown Structure
